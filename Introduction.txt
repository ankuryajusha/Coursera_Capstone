Introduction:
This project will explore the area around a residential area based on the most popular locations in the area.
This location data will be used to create a model and cluster the locations.
Location data of most popular locations in another city will be explored.

The same model created earlier will be used to cluster the locations in the other city.

This will enable us to define which areas in the other city are most similar to the residential area in the first city.

If any person is moving to other city, they will be able to see the similar areas as in the first city.
